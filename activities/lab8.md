# Lab 8

## Implement login for your app
Use the guidance in [1_flask_login.md](https://github.com/nicholsons/comp0034_week8/blob/master/activities/1_flask_login.md) to implement login functionality for your web app. You will likely need to:

- Configure the application to use Flask-Login
- Add the required helper functions from UserMixin to your User class (or the appropriate class for your application)
- Add the required helper functions to manage safe redirects and user_loader function
- Add routes for login and logout
- Add login/logout to the navbar
- Require a user to be logged in to access the some of the pages of your web app

## Add your Dash app to your Flask app
There is guidance for adding a single page app in [2_add_dash_app.md](2_add_dash_app.md) and for adding a multi page app in [2_2_adding_multiple_dash_apps.md](2_2_adding_multiple_dash_apps.md)

## Implement features for your web app
Since the nature of each person or group's project is very different then you will need to work out which features you will start to work on and who does what.

There is additional guidance on using Flask-SQLAlchemy for creating table relationships and writing queries in [6_database_2.md](6_database_2.md).

There are links in the reading list for this week to some Flask tutorials and packages that cover the types of community features you might want to implement; there are also links in a week 8 optional [Moodle activity here](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=3398136).
