# Lab 8

## Implement login for your app
Use the guidance in [1_flask_login.md](https://github.com/nicholsons/comp0034_week8/blob/master/activities/1_flask_login.md) (for video [see Moodle](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=2972670)) to implement login functionality for your web app. You will likely need to:

- Configure the application to use Flask-Login
- Add the required helper functions from UserMixin to your User class (or the appropriate class for your application)
- Add the required helper functions to manage safe redirects and user_loader function
- Add routes for login and logout
- Add login/logout to the navbar
- Require a user to be logged in to access the some of the pages of your web app


Note: If you wish to restrict your Dash app to logged in users then you will need to follow the guidance in the Dash app activities.

## Add your Dash app to your Flask app
There is guidance for adding a single page app in [2_add_dash_app.md](2_add_dash_app.md) ([video here](https://echo360.org.uk/ui/player/7769f41e-a094-4aa2-b32a-a719a6b02572?secureLinkAccessDataId=3fd22af1-ed62-413f-ac43-c2610ff3df4d&autoplay=false&automute=false)) and for adding a multi page app in [2_2_adding_multiple_dash_apps.md](2_2_adding_multiple_dash_apps.md).

## Implement features for your web app
Since the nature of each person or group's project is very different then you will need to work out which features you will start to work on and who does what.

There is additional guidance on using Flask-SQLAlchemy for creating table relationships and writing queries in [6_database_2.md](6_database_2.md) ([video via Moodle here](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=3401502)).

There are links in the reading list for this week to some Flask tutorials and packages that cover the types of community features you might want to implement; there are also links in a week 8 optional [Moodle activity here](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=3398136).
